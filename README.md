# The Lights

### Week One

My first experiment putting together an [A-Frame](https://aframe.io) scene, a web framework for building virtual reality experiences.

The purpuse is to practice with Lights and Shadows, and it's interactions with objects and materials.

## NEXT STEPS

- Continue Moving Light animation.
- Event set: On click, bounce animations for a-sphere + color change.
