# The Lights

My first experiment putting together an [A-Frame](https://aframe.io) scene, a web framework for building virtual reality experiences.

The purpuse is to practice with Lights and Shadows, and it's interactions with objects and materials.

## NEXT STEP

- Register GSLS Shader.
- Continue Moving Light animation.
